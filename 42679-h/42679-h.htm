            <span>I'd something else to think about:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>With something rich and prime to eat:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>All night beside the biggest fire.</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>A pleasant whiff of stewing burst</span>

            <span>Dead-certain of their fill of meat--</span>

            <span>I felt the bit between the teeth,</span>

            <span>The flying heels, the broken traces,</span>

            <span>Within the brightest coal for me...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Once more, I saw her, as she started,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And glanced at me with red lips parted:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as she looked, the frightened hare</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had fled her eyes; and, merrily,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She smiled, with fine teeth flashing white,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though she, too, were happy-hearted...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then she had trembled suddenly,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And dropped her eyes, as that fat man</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Stepped from the shadow of the van,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And joined the circle, as the pot</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was lifted off, and, piping-hot,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The supper steamed in wooden bowls.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Yet, she had hardly touched a bite:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And never raised her eyes all night</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To mine again: but on the coals,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As I sat staring, she had stared--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The black curls, shining round her head</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>From under the red kerchief, tied</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So nattily beneath her chin--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And she had stolen off to bed</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Quite early, looking dazed and scared.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, all agape and sleepy-eyed,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Ere long the others had turned in:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And I was rid of that fat man,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Who slouched away to his own van.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now, before her van, I lay,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With sleepless eyes, awaiting day:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I gazed upon the glare,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I heard, behind, a gentle stir:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, turning round, I looked on her</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Where she stood on the little stair</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Outside the van, with listening air--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, in her eyes, the hunted hare...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, I saw her slip away,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A bundle underneath her arm,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Without a single glance at me.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I lay a moment wondering,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>My heart a-thump like anything,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, fearing she should come to harm,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I rose, and followed speedily</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Where she had vanished in the night.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as she heard my step behind,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She started, and stopt dead with fright:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then blundered on as if struck blind:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now as I caught up with her,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Just as she took the moorland track,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw the hare's eyes, big and black...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She made as though she'd double back...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when she looked into my eyes,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She stood quite still and did not stir...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, picking up her fallen pack,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I tucked it 'neath my arm; and she</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Just took her luck quite quietly.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As she must take what chance might come,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And would not have it otherwise,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And walked into the night with me,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Without a word across the fells.</span>

          <div class="line">

          <div class="line">
            <span>The mists were stealing, cold and white,</span>

            <span>Down every rushy syke or slack:</span>

            <span>And singing like a burn in flood:</span>

            <span>My body was a rattled drum:</span>

            <span>That summer night, to think that she</span>

            <span>Was walking through the world with me.</span>

            <span>Half-strangled, struggling in the snare,</span>

            <span>Big, fearful, staggering and black;</span>

            <span>Through banks of Eastern cloud was breaking,</span>
